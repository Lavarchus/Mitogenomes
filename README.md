This repository contains bash and pbs script to run MitoFinder (Allio et al. 2020) on off-target sequences to harvest partial and complete mitochondrial genomes from UCE captured data.
Details on MitoFinder are available on developer's GitHub https://github.com/RemiAllio/MitoFinder

Scripts were used to expand mitochondrial genetic records and assemble mitogenomes for the reef-associated fish family Pomacanthidae. Results are presented in:
Baraf et al. (2024). Comparative mitogenomics of marine angelfishes (F: Pomacanthidae). Ecology and Evolution, 14(8), e70127
